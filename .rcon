# Source RCON Protocol configuration file.

# Each server entry goes on a separate line and uses this format:
#
#	alias,IP address,port[,password]
#
# If you do not include the password in the entry, the application will prompt
# you for the password at runtime.  Do not leave a comma after the port number
# if you do not intend to add the password to the entry.  Doing so causes the
# application to believe your password is a newline - you won't be prompted
# for a password at runtime, and your access to the server will be denied
# (unless your password actually IS a newline).
